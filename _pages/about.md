## Philosophy
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">We think that the most effective way to create sustainable development for humanity is in automation of the world around us, while caring about each individual, our society and planet.
Work in the future is optional. People need to do only things they are fond of. Artomatica builds products to handle all the boring, uncomfortable tasks for our clients.</p>
