It was day preceding national holiday, Armed Forces Day. Unfortunately, everything is closed on national holidays in Poland.
I went to the small, but slow supermarket, "Biedrionka", with intention to make food supply before celebration. 

In cardboard boxes there are bananas, grapes, peaches. People scurry between cabbages and mucky watermelons.
While picking velvet springy plums, I saw her. 

She was dressed in a colorful stripy short dress, blue, red, green in vertical lines. Burning hair caress keen shoulders.  She stays near vegetables, with pots of peppermint above her head. Her small hands are throwing tomatoes in the plastic bag.

She intimidates me.
I wait. I pick up plums.

I didn't approach.

I am staying near milk section refrigirators, reading contents of the Mozzarella ball. Mozzarella tastes wonderfully with tomatoes and basil. She is looking over yogurts. Her long shapely legs land in white sandals, vinous fingernails. She is around 25.

I want her.
I stay near refrigirators. I am choosing cheese.

I didn't approach.

People are waiting alongside the conveyor belt. I am  on the checkout, looking at her from the top of the line.
She bought some pork, yogurt, carrot juice.
Our eyes met. She has breathtaking bright blue eyes. I want to see them everyday in the morning bedding. Eyes of the anticipated summer rain. We looked piercingly into each other for a few seconds. She looks away. <s>She slowly helds out hand and touched my throbbing dick</s>
She wants to be approached.

I said, thank you, to the cashier, good day, and left.

I didn't approach.
Instead, I went home, fried fish, chopped cucumber into the salad and made this blog.

## What is fatale?

_**fatale**_ is celebration of feminine beauty. It collects  the information from sneaky-tricky pick up books I have read, _hundreds of them_, awkward videos I have watched, as well as numerous hilarious mistakes I am making on the journey to become a lover beau id√©al. _French makes everything sexy._

_**fatale**_ is dedicated to woman in my life whom I loved vertiginously, woman whom I never met _(because I have been a pussy)_, woman who influenced me.

But most importantly,
_**fatale**_ is the call to action. In the arms of death we will regret not about what were done, but about that moment from youth, when she was so close and warm on the promenade of the Oder river. Yet, you didn't go for a kiss.

With courage and love, for this day and all the days to come: approach, learn from each interaction, make desires real.
